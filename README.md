Student Grade Tracker
Ever felt overwhelmed keeping track of your test marks and calculating percentages? This handy Java program, StudentGradeTracker, comes to the rescue! It helps you organize your test data, ensures valid marks are entered, and calculates percentages automatically. It even presents the information in a clear and easy-to-read table format.

This introduction piques the reader's interest by highlighting the problem the program solves and its key features. It avoids overly technical jargon and focuses on the benefits for the user.
1. Setting Up:
We import a tool (Scanner) to read what you type.
We create a program called StudentGradeTracker.
Inside the program, we create a tool (scanner) to get your input.

2. Getting Test Information:
The program asks you how many tests there are.
It creates a space to store your test details (marks and percentages) in a table-like format.

3. Entering Marks:
The program loops through each test, asking you for details.
For each test, it loops through each subject, prompting you for marks.
It ensures you enter valid marks between 0 and 100.

4. Calculating Percentages:
The program loops through each test again.
For each test, it calculates the total marks by adding up marks for all subjects.
It then calculates the percentage for the test by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects (adjust if needed).
It stores the calculated percentage in the table along with the marks.

5. Displaying Results:
The program prints a table header with labels for test number, subjects, and percentage.
It loops through each test again, printing the test number, marks for each subject, and the calculated percentage in a table format.

6. Bonus Information:
The program displays a message about an assignment deadline (you can customize this).
It calculates an "actual CGPA" based on the average percentage (this part can be adjusted or removed).

7. Closing Up:
The program closes the tool it used to get your input to avoid issues.
This paraphrased version uses simpler language and focuses on the key actions the code performs, making it easier to understand without the technical details.
